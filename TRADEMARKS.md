# Trademarks and branding

“Evencio” and related names/logos are trademarks of the project owners.

The code license (FSL-1.1-MIT) **does not** grant rights to use our trademarks, trade names, service marks, or product names beyond attribution/origin.

## What you MAY do

- Refer to the project name in text to identify the origin (e.g. “forked from …”, “based on …”)
- Keep default branding for **local development** and **internal evaluation**
- Include **minimal textual attribution** in documentation (no endorsement implied)

## What you MUST do for public forks / public deployments

If you publish or distribute a fork publicly (including hosting it for others), you must:
- Remove/replace Evencio branding (names, logos, product naming) from the UI and marketing materials
- Use your own project/company branding
- Avoid any wording that suggests official endorsement or affiliation

## What you MUST NOT do

- Use “Evencio” as your product/service name
- Use Evencio logos as your primary branding
- Present your fork as an official Evencio offering

## Note on temporary demos

If you’re only “getting it running” (e.g., early test deployments), default branding may still be visible.  
For any public production use, rebranding is required.
