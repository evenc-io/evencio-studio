# Ideas Workspace

This folder holds work-in-progress product ideas. Each idea lives in its own folder
with a consistent structure so it is easy to plan, phase, and execute.

## How to add a new idea
1) Copy `ideas/_template` into a new folder using a slug name, e.g. `ideas/idea-event-animations`.
2) Fill out the files in order: `phases/00-overview.md` -> `requirements/*` -> `todos/*`.
3) Keep decisions and risks up to date as you go.

## Naming convention
- `idea-<short-slug>` for new ideas
- Use lowercase with hyphens
