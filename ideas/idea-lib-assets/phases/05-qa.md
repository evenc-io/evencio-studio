# QA

## Test plan
- Unit tests for data model validation (tags, scopes, props schema)
- Integration tests for search/filter accuracy
- Render pipeline tests: deterministic output for same props
- Security tests for snippet sandbox restrictions

## Edge cases
- Asset with missing/invalid license metadata
- Snippet that attempts disallowed imports or APIs
- Tag rename affecting search results
- Asset version rollback

## Performance checks
- Search/filter under 200ms for typical org library
- PNG render time within acceptable bounds (target < 2s)

## Accessibility checks
- Keyboard navigation through filters and grid
- Focus states visible on interactive controls
- Screen-reader labels on asset cards
